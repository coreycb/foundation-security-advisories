  CVE-2018-5147:
    title: Out of bounds memory write in libtremor
    impact: critical
    reporter: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala
    description: |
      The libtremor library has the same flaw as CVE-2018-5146. This library is used by Firefox in place of libvorbis on Android and ARM platforms.<br>*Update: The 52.7.2 source release accidentally did not include this patch (the Mozilla-produced 52.7.2 binaries are fine). Anyone building 52.7.2 on ARM should use <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr52/rev/5cd5586a2f48424a9031a3fa4c782954a9df9a52">revision 5cd5586a2f48424a9031a3fa4c782954a9df9a52</a> instead of the released source.
