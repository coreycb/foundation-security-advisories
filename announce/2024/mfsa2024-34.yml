    title: CSP strict-dynamic bypass using web-compatibility shims
    impact: high
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |
      Firefox adds web-compatibility shims in place of some tracking scripts blocked by Enhanced Tracking Protection.  On a site protected by Content Security Policy in "strict-dynamic" mode, an attacker able to inject an HTML element could have used a DOM Clobbering attack on some of the shims and achieved XSS, bypassing the CSP strict-dynamic protection.

  CVE-2024-7531:
    title: PK11_Encrypt using CKM_CHACHA20 can reveal plaintext on Intel Sandy Bridge machines
    impact: low
    reporter: Lars Eggert
    description: |
      Calling PK11_Encrypt() in NSS using CKM_CHACHA20 and the same buffer for input and output can result in plaintext on an Intel Sandy Bridge processor. In Firefox this only affects the QUIC header protection feature when the connection is using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suite. The most likely outcome is connection failure, but if the connection persists despite the high packet loss it could be possible for a network observer to identify packets as coming from the same source despite a network path change.
