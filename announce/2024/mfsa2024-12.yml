  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1872920:
    title: Windows Error Reporter could be used as a Sandbox escape vector
    impact: high
    reporter: Milo≈°
    description: |
      An attacker could leverage the Windows Error Reporter to run arbitrary code on the system escaping the sandbox. Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.
    bugs:
      - url: 1872920
  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1879237:
    title: Mishandling of WASM register values
    impact: high
    reporter: P1umer
    description: |
      Passing invalid data could, for example, lead to invalid wasm values being created, such as arbitrary integers turning into pointer values.
    bugs:
      - url: 1879237
  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1879939:
    title: JIT code failed to save return registers on Armv7-A
    impact: high
    reporter: Gary Kwong
    description: |
      Return registers were overwritten which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
Note: This issue only affected Armv7-A systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.

  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1880692:
    title: Integer overflow could lead to out of bounds write
    impact: high
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      AppendEncodedAttributeValue(), ExtraSpaceNeededForAttrEncoding() and AppendEncodedCharacters() could experience integer overflows, causing underallocation of an output buffer leading to an out of bounds write.
    bugs:
      - url: 1880692
  CVE-2023-5388:
    title: NSS susceptible to timing attack against RSA decryption
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Hubert Kario
    description: |
      NSS was susceptible to a timing side-channel attack when performing RSA decryption. This attack could potentially allow an attacker to recover the private data.

  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1866100:
    title: Permission prompt input delay could expire when not in focus
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Shaheen Fazim
    description: |
      The permission prompt input delay could expire while the window is not in focus. This makes it vulnerable to clickjacking by malicious websites.
    bugs:
      - url: 1866100
  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1871112:
    title: Improper handling of html and body tags enables CSP nonce leakage
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Georg Felber and Marco Squarcina (TU Wien)
    description: |
      Using a markup injection an attacker could steal nonce values. This can be used to bypass strict content security policies.
    bugs:
      - url: 1871112
  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1876675:
    title: Clickjacking vulnerability could lead to user accidentally granting permissions
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Hafiizh
    description: |
      A missing delay on when pointer lock is used could allow a malicious page to trick a user into granting permissions.
    bugs:
      - url: 1876675
  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1879444:
    title: Self referencing object could potentially lead to a use-after-free
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      If an attacker could find a way to trigger this code path it could trigger a crash or potentially be leveraged to achieve code execution.
    bugs:
      - url: 1879444
  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1875701:
    title: Improper handling of QUIC ACK frame data can lead to OOM
    impact: low
    reporter: Max Inden
    description: |
      Data was not properly sanitized when decoding a QUIC ACK frame, this could lead to unrestricted memory consumption and a crash.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 124, Firefox ESR 115.9, and Thunderbird 115.9
    impact: high
    reporter: Ryan VanderMeulen, Noah Lokocz, Kevin Brosnan [Ex-Mozilla], the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 123, Firefox ESR 115.8, and Thunderbird 115.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
