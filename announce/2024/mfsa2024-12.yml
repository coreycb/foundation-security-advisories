    title: Permission prompt input delay could expire when not in focus
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Shaheen Fazim
    description: |
      The permission prompt input delay could have expired while the window is not in focus, which made the prompt vulnerable to clickjacking by malicious websites.

  CVE-2024-2610:
    title: Improper handling of html and body tags enabled CSP nonce leakage
    impact: moderate

    title: Self referencing object could have potentially led to a use-after-free
    impact: moderate
