  CVE-2024-11694:
    title: CSP Bypass and XSS Exposure via Web Compatibility Shims
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |
      Enhanced Tracking Protection's Strict mode may have inadvertently allowed a CSP `frame-src` bypass and DOM-based XSS through the Google SafeFrame shim in the Web Compatibility extension. This issue could have exposed users to malicious frames masquerading as legitimate content.

  CVE-2024-11696:
    title: Unhandled Exception in Add-on Signature Verification
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rob Wu
    description: |
      The application failed to account for exceptions thrown by the `loadManifestFromFile` method during add-on signature verification. This flaw, triggered by an invalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have been bypassed.  Signature validation in this context is used to ensure that third-party applications on the user's computer have not tampered with the user's extensions, limiting the impact of this issue.

    title: Potential Double-Free Vulnerability in PKCS#7 Decryption Handling
    impact: low
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      A double-free issue could have occurred in `sec_pkcs7_decoder_start_decrypt()` when handling an error path. Under specific conditions, the same symmetric key could have been freed twice, potentially leading to memory corruption.

  CVE-2024-11698:
    title: Fullscreen Lock-Up When Modal Dialog Interrupts Transition on macOS
    impact: low
    reporter: Kang Ali of Punggawa Cybersecurity
    description: |
      A flaw in handling fullscreen transitions may have inadvertently caused the application to become stuck in fullscreen mode when a modal dialog was opened during the transition. This issue left users unable to exit fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing "Esc" or accessing right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the browser is restarted.  <br>*This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2024-11705:
    title: Null Pointer Dereference in NSC_DeriveKey
    impact: low
    reporter: coffeys
    description: |
      <code>NSC_DeriveKey</code> inadvertently assumed that the <code>phKey</code> parameter is always non-NULL. When it was passed as NULL, a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurred, leading to crashes. This behavior conflicted with the PKCS#11 v3.0 specification, which allows <code>phKey</code> to be NULL for certain mechanisms.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 133, Thunderbird 133, Firefox ESR 128.5, and Thunderbird 128.5
    impact: high
    reporter: Andrew McCreight, Akmat Suleimanov
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 132, Thunderbird 132, Firefox ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
