  CVE-2024-5687:
    title: An incorrect principal could have been used when opening new tabs
    impact: high
    reporter: jackyzy823
    description: |
      If a specific sequence of actions is performed when opening a new tab, the triggering principal associated with the new tab may have been incorrect. The triggering principal is used to calculate many values, including the <code>Referer</code> and <code>Sec-*</code> headers, meaning there is the potential for incorrect security checks within the browser in addition to incorrect or misleading information sent to remote websites.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.*
