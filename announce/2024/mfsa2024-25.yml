    title: An incorrect principal could have been used when opening new tabs
    impact: high
    reporter: jackyzy823
    description: |
      If a specific sequence of actions is performed when opening a new tab, the triggering principal associated with the new tab may have been incorrect. The triggering principal is used to calculate many values, including the <code>Referer</code> and <code>Sec-*</code> headers, meaning there is the potential for incorrect security checks within the browser in addition to incorrect or misleading information sent to remote websites.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

    title: User confusion and possible phishing vector via Firefox Screenshots
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Fabian Fäßler
    description: |
      In addition to detecting when a user was taking a screenshot (XXX), a website was able to overlay the 'My Shots' button that appeared, and direct the user to a replica Firefox Screenshots page that could be used for phishing.

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Luan Herrera

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Raphael Shaniyazov and Axel Chong (@Haxatron)
    description: |
      On Windows, when using the 'Save As' functionality, an attacker could have tricked the browser into saving the file with a disallowed extension such as <code>.url</code> by including an invalid character in the extension. *Note:* This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan

      If an out-of-memory condition occurs at a specific point using allocations in the probabilistic heap checker, an assertion could have been triggered, and in rarer situations, memory corruption could have occurred.

    title: Memory Corruption in Text Fragments
    impact: moderate

    impact: low
    reporter: Hafiizh
    description: |
      By manipulating the fullscreen feature while opening a data-list, an attacker could have overlaid a text box over the address bar. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.

  MFSA-RESERVE-2024-1891349:
    title: Cookie prefixes not treated as case-sensitive
    impact: low
    reporter: Konstantin Preißer
    description: |
      In violation of spec, cookie prefixes such as <code>__Secure</code> were being ignored if they were not correctly capitalized - by spec they should be checked with a case-insensitive comparison. This could have resulted in the browser not correctly honoring the behaviors specified by the prefix.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 127, Firefox ESR 115.12, and Thunderbird 115.12
    impact: high
    reporter: The Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 126, Firefox ESR 115.11, and Thunderbird 115.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
