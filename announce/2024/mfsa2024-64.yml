    title: CSP Bypass and XSS Exposure via Web Compatibility Shims
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |

  CVE-2024-11696:
    title: Unhandled Exception in Add-on Signature Verification
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rob Wu
    description: |
      The application failed to account for exceptions thrown by the `loadManifestFromFile` method during add-on signature verification. This flaw, triggered by an invalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have been bypassed.  Signature validation in this context is used to ensure that third-party applications on the user's computer have not tampered with the user's extensions, limiting the impact of this issue.

    title: Improper Keypress Handling in Executable File Confirmation Dialog
    impact: low
    reporter: Umar Farooq
    description: |
      When handling keypress events, an attacker may have been able to trick a user into bypassing the "Open Executable File?" confirmation dialog. This could have led to malicious code execution.

  CVE-2024-11698:
    title: Fullscreen Lock-Up When Modal Dialog Interrupts Transition on macOS
    impact: low
    reporter: Kang Ali of Punggawa Cybersecurity
    description: |
      A flaw in handling fullscreen transitions may have inadvertently caused the application to become stuck in fullscreen mode when a modal dialog was opened during the transition. This issue left users unable to exit fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing "Esc" or accessing right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the browser is restarted.  <br>*This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2024-11699:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 133, Firefox ESR 128.5, and Thunderbird 128.5
    impact: high
    reporter: Akmat Suleimanov, Andrew McCreight
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 132, Firefox ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
