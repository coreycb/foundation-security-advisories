  CVE-2024-50336:
    title: matrix-js-sdk has insufficient MXC URI validation which could allow client-side path traversal
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Patrick Cloke
    description: |
      The Matrix specification demands homeservers to perform validation of the server-name and media-id components of MXC URIs with the intent to prevent path traversal. However, it is not mentioned that a similar check must also be performed on the client to prevent client-side path traversal. matrix-js-sdk fails to perform this validation.
