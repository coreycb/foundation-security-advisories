    title: Out-of-bounds read in clipboard component

    title: Leaving pointerlock by pressing the escape key could be prevented
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      It was possible to prevent a user from exiting pointerlock when pressing
      escape
      and to overlay customValidity notifications from a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element over certain
      permission prompts. This could be used to confuse a user into giving a site unintended permissions.

    title: Form validation popups could block exiting full-screen mode

    reporter: Raphael
    description: |
      Form validation popups could capture escape key presses. Therefore, spamming form validation messages could be used to prevent users from exiting full-screen mode.

    title: Memory corruption in WebGL API
    impact: moderate
    reporter: pwn2car

    title: Memory corruption in thread creation
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      In an out-of-memory scenario an allocation could fail but free would have been called on the pointer afterwards leading to memory corruption.

    title: Incorrect handling of SameSite cookies

    title: CSP violation leakage when using devtools
    impact: low
    reporter: Aidan Stephenson & Yannik Marchand
    description: |
      CSP violations generated links in the console tab of the developer tools, pointing to the violating resource. This caused a DNS prefetch which leaked that a CSP violation happened.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 128, Firefox ESR 115.13, and Thunderbird 115.13
    impact: high
    reporter: Randell Jesup
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 127, Firefox ESR 115.12, and Thunderbird 115.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
