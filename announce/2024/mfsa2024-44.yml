  CVE-2024-8382:
    title: Internal event interfaces were exposed to web content when browser EventHandler listener callbacks ran
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Gregory Pappas
    description: |
      Internal browser event interfaces were exposed to web content when privileged EventHandler listener callbacks ran for those events. Web content that tried to use those interfaces would not be able to use them with elevated privileges, but their presence would indicate certain browser features had been used, such as when a user opened the Dev Tools console.

  CVE-2024-8383:
    title: 'Thunderbird did not ask before openings news: links in an external application'
    impact: moderate
    reporter: D7
    description: |
      Thunderbird normally asks for confirmation before asking the operating system to find an application to handle a scheme that the browser does not support. It did not ask before doing so for the Usenet-related schemes news: and snews:. Since most operating systems don't have a trusted newsreader installed by default, an unscrupulous program that the user downloaded could register itself as a handler. The website that served the application download could then launch that application at will.

    impact: moderate
    reporter: the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    description: |
      The JavaScript garbage collector could mis-color cross-compartment objects if OOM conditions were detected at the right point between two passes. This could have led to memory corruption.
