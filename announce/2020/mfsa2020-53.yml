    title: Stack overflow due to incorrect parsing of SMTP server response codes
    impact: high
    reporter: Chiaki Ishikawa
    description: |
      When reading SMTP server status codes, Thunderbird writes an integer value to a position on the stack that is intended to contain just one byte. Depending on processor architecture and stack layout, this leads to stack corruption that may be exploitable.
