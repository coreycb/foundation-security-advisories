      If a user downloaded a file lacking an extension on Windows, and then "Open"-ed it from the downloads panel, if there was an executable file in the downloads directory with the same name but with an executable extension (such as .bat or .exe) that executable would have been launched instead.<br>*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    impact: high
    reporter: Christian Holler
    description: |
      Mozilla developer Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
