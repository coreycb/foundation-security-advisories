    title: Use-After-Free in WebGL
    impact: high
    reporter: Brian Carpenter via the ASAN Nightly project
    description: |
      The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-26975:
    title: Malicious applications on Android could have induced Firefox for Android into sending arbitrary attacker-specified headers
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Pedro Oliveira
    description: |
      When a malicious application installed on the user's device broadcast an Intent to Firefox for Android, arbitrary headers could have been specified, leading to attacks such as abusing ambient authority or session fixation. This was resolved by only allowing certain safe-listed headers.<br>*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Samy Kamkar, Ben Seri, and Gregory Vishnepolsky
    description: |
      Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine.

  CVE-2020-26979:
    title: When entering an address in the address or search bars, a website could have redirected the user before they were navigated to the intended url
    impact: low
    reporter: David Schütz
    description: |
      When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it.

  CVE-2020-35111:
    title: The proxy.onRequest API did not catch view-source URLs

      If a user downloaded a file lacking an extension on Windows, and then "Open"-ed it from the downloads panel, if there was an executable file in the downloads directory with the same name but with an executable extension (such as .bat or .exe) that executable would have been launched instead.<br>*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6
    impact: high
    reporter: Christian Holler
    description: |
      Mozilla developer Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
