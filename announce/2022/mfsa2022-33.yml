    title: Address bar spoofing via XSLT error handling
    impact: high
    reporter: Armin Ebert

  CVE-2022-38474:
    title: Recording notification not shown when microphone was recording on Android
    impact: low
    reporter: Agi Sferro
    description: |
      A website that had permission to access the microphone could record audio without the audio notification being shown. This bug does not allow the attacker to bypass the permission prompt - it only affects the notification shown once permission has been granted.<br />*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 104 and Firefox ESR 102.2

    description: |
      Mozilla developer Nika Layzell and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 103 and Firefox ESR 102.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
