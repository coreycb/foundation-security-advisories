    title: Firefox did not implement the CSP directive unsafe-hashes
    impact: moderate

    description: |
      Because Firefox did not implement the <code>unsafe-hashes</code> CSP directive, an attacker who was able to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject executable script.  This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the document.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 108 and Firefox ESR 102.6
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
