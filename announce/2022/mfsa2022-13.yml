  CVE-2022-28284:
    title: Script could be executed via svg's use element
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Leo Balter
    description: |
      SVG's <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element could have been used to load unexpected content that could have executed script in certain circumstances. While the specification seems to allow this, other browsers do not, and web developers relied on this property for script security so gecko's implementation was aligned with theirs.

    title: Incorrect AliasSet used in JIT Codegen
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Lukas Bernhard
    description: |
      When generating the assembly code for <code>MLoadTypedArrayElementHole</code>, an incorrect AliasSet was used. In conjunction with another vulnerability this could have been used for an out of bounds memory read.

  CVE-2022-28289:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 99 and Firefox ESR 91.8
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Nika Layzell, Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 98 and Firefox ESR 91.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
