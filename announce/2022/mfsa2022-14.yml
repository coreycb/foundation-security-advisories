  CVE-2022-28289:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 99 and Firefox ESR 91.8
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Nika Layzell, Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 98 and Firefox ESR 91.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
