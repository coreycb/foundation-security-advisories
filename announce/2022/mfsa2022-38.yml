  CVE-2022-3033:
    title: Leaking of sensitive information when composing a response to an HTML email with a META refresh tag
    impact: high
    reporter: Sarah Jamie Lewis
    description: |
      If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag
      having the <code>http-equiv="refresh"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then
      Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block
      remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email,
      it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the
      message compose document. 
      The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited
      to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted
      original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data 
      in the crafted email.
      The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag,
      or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document.
      This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to
      'simple html' or 'plain text'.

  CVE-2022-3032:
    title: Remote content specified in an HTML document that was nested inside an iframe's srcdoc attribute was not blocked
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Sarah Jamie Lewis
    description: |
      When receiving an HTML email that contained an <code>iframe</code> element, which used a <code>srcdoc</code> attribute to define the inner HTML document, remote objects specified in the nested document, for example images or videos, were not blocked. Rather, the network was accessed, the objects were loaded and displayed.

        Thunderbird users who use the Matrix chat protocol were vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.
