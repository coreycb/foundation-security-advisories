    title: Attacker-influenced path traversal when saving downloaded files
    impact: high
    reporter: Chaobin Zhang
    description: |
      When downloading files on Windows, the % character was not escaped, which could have lead to a download incorrectly being saved to attacker-influenced paths that used variables such as %HOMEPATH% or %APPDATA%.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    title: Uninitialized variable leads to invalid memory read
    impact: high

  CVE-2022-1834:
    title: Braille space character caused incorrect sender email to be shown for a digitally signed email
    impact: high
    reporter: Jonathan von Niessen
    description: |
      When displaying the sender of an email, and the sender name contained the Braille Pattern Blank space character multiple times, Thunderbird would have displayed all the spaces. This could have been used by an attacker to send an email message with the attacker's digital signature, that was shown with an arbitrary sender email address chosen by the attacker. If the sender name started with a false email address, followed by many Braille space characters, the attacker's email address was not visible. Because Thunderbird compared the invisible sender address with the signature's email address, if the signing key or certificate was accepted by Thunderbird, the email was shown as having a valid digital signature.

  CVE-2022-31742:
    title: Querying a WebAuthn token with a large number of allowCredential entries may have leaked cross-origin information
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Michal
    description: |
      An attacker could have exploited a timing attack by sending a large number of allowCredential entries and detecting the difference between invalid key handles and cross-origin key handles.  This could have led to cross-origin account linking in violation of WebAuthn goals.

  CVE-2022-31747:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 91.10
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Nicolas B. Pierron, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
