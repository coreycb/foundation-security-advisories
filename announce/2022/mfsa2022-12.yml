  CVE-2022-26386:
    title: Temporary files downloaded to /tmp and accessible by other local users
    impact: low
    reporter: attila
    description: |
      Previously Thunderbird for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a user-specific directory in <code>/tmp</code>, but this behavior was changed to download them to <code>/tmp</code> where they could be affected by other local users.  This behavior was reverted to the original, user-specific directory. <br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for macOS and Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
