  CVE-2021-38502:
    title: Downgrade attack on SMTP STARTTLS connections
    impact: high
    reporter: Mattias Jacobsson
    description: |
      Thunderbird ignored the configuration to require STARTTLS security for an SMTP connection. A MITM could perform a downgrade attack to intercept transmitted messages, or could take control of the authenticated session to execute SMTP commands chosen by the MITM. If an unprotected authentication method was configured, the MITM could obtain the authentication credentials, too.

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Maor Kleinberger
    description: |

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 91.2
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Andreas Pehrson and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
