    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan

  CVE-2021-29974:
    title: HSTS errors could be overridden when network partitioning was enabled
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Peter Gerber
    description: |
      When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically.

    title: Text message could be overlaid on top of another website
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      Through a series of DOM manipulations, a message, over which the attacker had control of the text but not HTML or formatting, could be overlaid on top of another domain (with the new domain correctly shown in the address bar) resulting in possible user confusion.

  CVE-2021-29976:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 90 and Firefox ESR 78.12
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Emil Ghitta, Tyson Smith, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 89 and Firefox ESR 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
