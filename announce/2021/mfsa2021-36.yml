  CVE-2021-29986:
    title: Race condition when resolving DNS names could have led to memory corruption
    impact: high
    reporter: pahhur
    description: |
      A suspected race condition when calling <code>getaddrinfo</code> led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. <br>*Note: This issue only affected Linux operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2021-29981:
    title: Live range splitting could have led to conflicting assignments in the JIT
    impact: high
    reporter: Gary Kwong
    description: |
      An issue present in lowering/register allocation could have led to obscure but deterministic register confusion failures in JITted code that would lead to a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2021-29988:
    title: Memory corruption as a result of incorrect style treatment
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      Thunderbird incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2021-29984:
    title: Incorrect instruction reordering during JIT optimization
    impact: high
    reporter: Lukas Bernhard
    description: |
      Instruction reordering resulted in a sequence of instructions that would cause an object to be incorrectly considered during garbage collection. This led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2021-29980:
    title: Uninitialized memory in a canvas object could have led to memory corruption
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      Uninitialized memory in a canvas object could have caused an incorrect free() leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2021-29987:
    title: Users could have been tricked into accepting unwanted permissions on Linux
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      After requesting multiple permissions, and closing the first permission panel, subsequent permission panels will be displayed in a different position but still record a click in the default location, making it possible to trick a user into accepting a permission they did not want to.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2021-29985:
    title: Use-after-free media channels
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos
    description: |
      A use-after-free vulnerability in media channels could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2021-29982:
    title: Single bit data leak due to incorrect JIT optimization and type confusion
    impact: low
    reporter: Lukas Bernhard
    description: |
      Due to incorrect JIT optimization, we incorrectly interpreted data from the wrong type of object, resulting in the potential leak of a single bit of memory.

  CVE-2021-29989:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 91
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    feed: false
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang, Philipp, Chris Peterson, Sebastian Hengst, Christoph Kerschbaumer, Olli Pettay, Sandor Molnar, and Simon Giesecke reported memory safety bugs present in versions of Thunderbird prior to 91. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
