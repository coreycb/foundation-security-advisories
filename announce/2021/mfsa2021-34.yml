    description: |
      Mozilla developers Christoph Kerschbaumer, Simon Giesecke, Sandor Molnar, and Olli Pettay reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 90 and Firefox ESR 78.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
