    title: Use-after-free in Responsive Design Mode
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      When Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that were previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

    title: Secure Lock icon could have been spoofed

    title: Blob URLs may have been granted additional privileges
    impact: moderate

  CVE-2021-24000:
    title: requestPointerLock() could be applied to a tab different from the visible tab
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      A race condition with <code>requestPointerLock()</code> and <code>setTimeout()</code> could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code>) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to.

    title: Testing code could have enabled session history manipulations by a compromised content process

  CVE-2021-24002:
    title: Arbitrary FTP command execution on FTP servers using an encoded URL
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Daniel Santos
    description: |
      When a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D), the newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed arbitrary commands to be sent to the FTP server.

    title: Incorrect size computation in WebAssembly JIT could lead to null-reads

    impact: low
    reporter: Wladimir Palant working with Include Security
