  CVE-2021-29969:
    title: IMAP server responses sent by a MITM prior to STARTTLS could be processed
    impact: high
    reporter: Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising
    description: |
      If Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and an attacker injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the STARTTLS handshake, then Thunderbird didn't ignore the injected data. This could have resulted in Thunderbird showing incorrect information, for example the attacker could have tricked Thunderbird to show folders that didn't exist on the IMAP server.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.12
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Valentin Gosu, Randell Jesup, Emil Ghitta, Tyson Smith, and Olli Pettay reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
