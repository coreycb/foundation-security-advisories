  CVE-2021-23969:
    title: Content Security Policy violation report could have contained the destination of a redirect
    impact: high
    reporter: Masato Kinugawa
    description: |
      As specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a violation report, "User agents need to ensure that the source file is the URL requested by the page, pre-redirects. If thatâ€™s not possible, user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin to avoid unintentional leakage." Under certain types of redirects, Thunderbird incorrectly set the source file to be the destination of the redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect destination's origin.

  CVE-2021-23968:
    title: Content Security Policy violation report could have contained the destination of a redirect
    impact: high
    reporter: Ademar Nowasky Junior
    description: |
      If Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect served in the frame was reported in the violation report; as opposed to the original frame URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs.

  CVE-2021-23978:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.8
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Alexis Beingessner, Tyson Smith, Nika Layzell, and Mats Palmgren reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
