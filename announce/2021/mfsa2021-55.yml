  CVE-2021-4126:
    title: OpenPGP signature status doesn't consider additional message content
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Kai Engert
    description: |
      When receiving an OpenPGP/MIME signed email message that contains an
      additional outer MIME message layer, for example a message footer added by a
      mailing list gateway, Thunderbird only considered the inner signed message for
      the signature validity. This gave the false impression that the additional contents
      were also covered by the digital signature. Starting with Thunderbird version 91.4.1,
      only the signature that belongs to the top level MIME part will be considered for
      the displayed status.

    title: Matrix chat library libolm bundled with Thunderbird vulnerable to a buffer overflow
    impact: moderate
    reporter: brevilo
    description: |
      Thunderbird users who use the Matrix chat protocol were vulnerable
      to a buffer overflow in libolm, that an attacker may trigger by a crafted
      sequence of  messages. The overflow content is partially controllable
      by the attacker and limited to ASCII spaces and digits.
