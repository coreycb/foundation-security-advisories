    title: One-time permissions granted to a local file were extended to other local files loaded in the same tab

    description: |
      If temporary "one-time" permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted to a document loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from a file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from different sources, such as in a download directory.

    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 110 and Firefox ESR 102.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
