    impact: high
    reporter: DoHyun Lee

  CVE-2023-29532:
    title: Mozilla Maintenance Service Write-lock bypass
    impact: high
    reporter: Holger Fuhrmannek
    description: |
      A local attacker can trick the Mozilla Maintenance Service into applying an unsigned update file by pointing the service at an update file on a malicious SMB server. The update file can be replaced after the signature check, before the use, because the write-lock requested by the service does not work on a SMB server.<br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

    title: Content-Disposition filename truncation leads to Reflected File Download
    impact: moderate

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 112 and Firefox ESR 102.10
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers Andrew Osmond, Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 111 and Firefox ESR 102.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
