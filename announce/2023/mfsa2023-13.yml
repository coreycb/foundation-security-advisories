  CVE-2023-29532:
    title: Mozilla Maintenance Service Write-lock bypass
    impact: high
    reporter: Holger Fuhrmannek
    description: |
      A local attacker can trick the Mozilla Maintenance Service into applying an unsigned update file by pointing the service at an update file on a malicious SMB server. The update file can be replaced after the signature check, before the use, because the write-lock requested by the service does not work on a SMB server.<br>*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*
