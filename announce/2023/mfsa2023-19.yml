    title: Click-jacking certificate exceptions through rendering lag
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the activation-delay 
Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs from attacks that exploit 
human response time delays. If a malicious page elicited user clicks in precise 
locations immediately before navigating to a site with a certificate error and 
made the renderer extremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap 
between when the error page was loaded and when the display actually 
refreshed. With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and 
activate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 114 and Firefox ESR 102.12

    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members the Mozilla Fuzzing Team,
Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, Sebastian Hengst, and Sean Feng reported
memory safety bugs present in Firefox 113 and Firefox ESR 102.11. Some of
these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
