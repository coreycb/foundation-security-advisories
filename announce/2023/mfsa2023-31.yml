    title: Fix potential race conditions when releasing platform objects

    title: Stack buffer overflow in StorageManager
    impact: high

  MFSA-RESERVE-2023-0008:
    title: File deletion and privilege escalation through Firefox uninstaller
    impact: moderate
    reporter: ycdxsb
    description: |
      The Firefox updater created a directory writable by non-privileged users. When uninstalling Firefox, any files in that directory would be recursively deleted with the permissions of the uninstalling user account. This could be combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link) to allow arbitrary file deletion controlled by the non-privileged user. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    title: Lack of warning when opening appref-ms files
    impact: moderate
    reporter: P Umar Farooq
    description: |
      When opening appref-ms files, Firefox did not warn the user that these files may contain malicious code. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  MFSA-RESERVE-2023-0011:
    title: Cookie jar overflow caused unexpected cookie jar state
    impact: low
    reporter: Marco Squarcina
    description: |
      When the number of cookies per domain was exceeded in <code>document.cookie</code>, the actual cookie jar sent to the host was no longer consistent with expected cookie jar state. This could have caused requests to be sent with some cookies missing.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 115.1, Firefox ESR 102.14, Thunderbird 115.1, and Thunderbird 102.14
    impact: high
    reporter: Dianna Smith, Ryan VanderMeulen, Timothy Nikkel, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, Firefox ESR 102.13, Thunderbird 115.0, and Thunderbird 102.13. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
