    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 102.11
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Andrew Osmond, Emily McDonough, Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 102.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
