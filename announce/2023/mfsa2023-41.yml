    title: Out-of-bounds write in HTTP Alternate Services
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      In a non-standard configuration of Firefox, an integer overflow could have occurred based on network traffic (possibly under influence of a local unprivileged webpage), leading to an out-of-bounds write to privileged process memory. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox if a non-standard preference allowing non-HTTPS Alternate Services (<code>network.http.altsvc.oe</code>) is enabled.*

  CVE-2023-5174:
    title: Double-free in process spawning on Windows
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ronald Crane
    description: |
      If Windows failed to duplicate a handle during process creation, the sandbox code may have inadvertently freed a pointer twice, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows when run in non-standard configurations (such as using <code>runas</code>). Other operating systems are unaffected.*

    description: |
      Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 117, Firefox ESR 115.2, and Thunderbird 115.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
