  CVE-2023-34414:
    title: Click-jacking certificate exceptions through rendering lag
    impact: high
    reporter: Irvan Kurniawan
    description: |
      The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the
      activation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs
      from attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious
      page elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before
      navigating to a site with a certificate error and made the renderer
      extremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between when
      the error page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed.
      With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and 
      activate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site.

  CVE-2023-34415:
    title: 'Site-isolation bypass on sites that allow open redirects to data: urls'
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
      When choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a
      data: URL that was the result of a redirect, Firefox would load that
      document in the same process as the site that issued the redirect. This
      bypassed the site-isolation protections against Spectre-like attacks
      on sites that host an "open redirect". Firefox no longer follows HTTP
      redirects to data: URLs.

  CVE-2023-34416:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 114 and Firefox ESR 102.12
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Andrew McCreight,
      the Mozilla Fuzzing Team, Sean Feng, and Sebastian Hengst reported memory
      safety bugs present in Firefox 113 and Firefox ESR 102.11. Some of these
      bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
      effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
